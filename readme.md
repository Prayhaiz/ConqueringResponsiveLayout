This is a short Ptoject anchored by Kelvin Powell in "**Conquering Responsive Layout**". I started some couple of weeks back 🥱 but although am still far behind 🏃🏻 and i have treated it before but treating it again makes it more clear 🙋 and understandable  👍.

The project is all about making use of width on the child element and using more of padding not setting a fixed width and height on elemets as it removes the element from been responsive so **"i learnt that"**.

Moving unto 🐸 Flexbox Basis now.


Still have a long way to go 🏎️ ,

Studying CSS a little better after moving on to Javascript fully and unto react but for now baby steps on css.
